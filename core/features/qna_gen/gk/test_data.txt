Mukhyamantri Gramin Awas NYAY Yojana

A Delayed Start: Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
The groundwork for the Mukhyamantri Gramin Awas NYAY Yojana was originally laid through the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana in collaboration with the Central Government back in 2021. However, the implementation of this joint effort was deferred due to a financial roadblock – the Chhattisgarh government’s inability to contribute its share of the funds, as cited by the Central Government. On the other hand, the state government contended that the pandemic had left them cash-strapped, making it impossible to execute the scheme.

A Socio-Economic Survey for Targeted Assistance
Earlier this year, Chhattisgarh’s Chief Minister, Bhupesh Baghel, took a proactive step by announcing a socio-economic survey in the absence of a decennial census in India post the 2011 Census. The survey, conducted on 59.79 lakh families, identified 10,76,545 families residing in kutcha (fragile) houses.

A Holistic Approach to Housing
Building upon the survey findings, Chief Minister Baghel, in July, introduced the Mukhyamantri Gramin Awas NYAY Yojana, pledging full financial support for its implementation. Families excluded from the housing scheme due to improvements in their living standards, as well as those still in need but not eligible according to the 2011 survey list, are set to benefit from this initiative.

First Phase Beneficiaries
In the fiscal year 2023-24, a total of 47,090 homeless families, identified in the Chhattisgarh Socio-Economic Census 2023, will receive assistance under the state government’s housing scheme. Families in remote areas will be granted Rs 1.30 lakh, while those in plain areas will receive Rs 1.20 lakh to support their housing needs.

Chhattisgarh’s Departure from Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana
In November 2021, the Central Government withdrew Chhattisgarh from the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Rural (PMAY-G) due to the state government’s failure to contribute its share since 2019. Under PMAY-G, the expenditure is shared between the Centre and states in a 60:10 ratio. The Centre’s decision followed Chhattisgarh’s inability to meet its financial commitment under the scheme despite multiple reminders and directives.


Unified Registration Portal for GOBARdhan – Current Updates (September, 2023)

Simplifying Registration with a Unified Portal
The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DDWS) announced the launch of the unified registration portal, aimed at simplifying the registration of CBG and biogas plants. This digital platform will facilitate smoother access to the Market Development Assistance (MDA) scheme offered by the Department of Fertilizers.

Eligibility for Market Development Assistance
Over 1,163 biogas plants and 426 CBG plants have already registered on this unified portal. These registered plants are now eligible for support under the Market Development Assistance (MDA) scheme.

New MDA Guidelines
Under the updated guidelines, CBG and biogas plants can receive MDA assistance amounting to Rs 1500 per metric ton (MT) for the sale of Fermented Organic Manure (FOM), Liquid Fermented Organic Manure (LFOM), and Phosphate Rich Organic Manure (PROM) produced through the GOBARdhan initiative.

Boosting the GOBARdhan Initiative
This development is expected to give a significant boost to the GOBARdhan initiative. By offering financial incentives for the sale of organic fertilizers produced from biogas and CBG plants, the initiative aims to encourage greater adoption and utilization of these valuable resources.

Registration and Compliance Requirements
To be eligible for MDA assistance, manufacturing plants must complete their registration on the unified GOBARdhan portal of the DDWS. Additionally, they must adhere to the specifications outlined in the Fertilizer Control Order (FCO) concerning organic fertilizers.

The Vision of GOBARdhan
The GOBARdhan initiative’s vision is to transform biodegradable and organic waste sources, including cattle dung, agricultural residues, and biomass, into high-value resources. This includes the production of biogas, CBG, and organic manure, contributing to a sustainable and eco-friendly future.
