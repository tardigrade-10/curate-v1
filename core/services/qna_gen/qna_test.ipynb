    "1. **System**: A part of the universe under study.\n",
    "2. **Surroundings**: Everything other than the system.\n",
    "3. **Thermodynamic State**: The description of a system in terms of properties like pressure, volume, temperature, etc.\n",
    "4. **State Functions**: Properties that depend only on the state of the system, not the path. Examples: U (Internal energy), H (Enthalpy), S (Entropy), and G (Gibbs free energy).\n",
    "5. **Path Functions**: Depend on the path taken during a change, like heat (q) and work (w).\n",
    "6. **First Law of Thermodynamics**: ΔU = q + w, where ΔU is the change in internal energy, q is heat, and w is work.\n",
