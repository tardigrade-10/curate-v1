CONTEXT_TEXT:

//context//

All water molecules form six-sided structures as they freeze and become snow 
crystals. The shape of the crystal is determined by temperature, vapor, and wind 
conditions in the upper atmosphere. Snow crystals are always symmetrical because 
these conditions affect all six sides simultaneously.

NOTES:
- You will use an external function to check the calculation.
- If the options and/or answer is correct, write as it is in the output.
- If the options and/or answer is incorrect, use your intelligence to choose the options in a very smart way.
- OUTPUT will be in the exact same format as the input. It will be processed as json.
- Only response with the json formatted output will be accepted. Do not write anything else.

In case you get unexpected output, for ex. fractions, approximations, etc., you will have to choose the options appropriately.
