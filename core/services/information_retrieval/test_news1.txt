However, based on recent research, this article documents the prevalence of gender- and caste-based disparities in the choice to study science. It highlights the role of households’ socioeconomic status, lack of access to schooling, and false beliefs and biases in explaining these disparities, and suggests that the social identity of teachers could have an impact on the uptake of science by disadvantaged groups. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is crucial for technological progress, and students with a knack for these subjects should have the opportunity to pursue them. However, there are socio-economic, gender, and racial disparities in pursuing STEM majors and careers. Despite the progress made by the Indian education system and successive government initiatives (including the District Primary Education Program in 1994, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in 2001, and the Right to Education Act in 2009) in reducing disparities based on gender and social category at different schooling levels, significant inequalities persist. These disparities become particularly evident when specialisation begins in higher-secondary education, especially among socio-economically disadvantaged groups (SEDGs) that have historically lacked representation in education. Even the National Education Policy (NEP) has acknowledged these disparities getting wider at higher levels of education, and to remedy this, calls for research-based policy measures specifically targeting each of the SEDGs. In two of our recent studies (Sahoo and Klasen 2021, Kumar and Sahoo 2023), we examine disparities based on caste and gender, two markers qualifying as SEDGs,  in the choice of streams at the higher-secondary level over the recent decade (2008-2017). Following ten years of comprehensive schooling, for grades 11-12, students typically choose between science, commerce, and humanities streams. Currently, studying in the science stream at the higher secondary level is a prerequisite to pursuing any STEM course for undergraduate and master’s degrees in most educational institutions in India. Although the NEP envisions moving towards a more holistic and multidisciplinary higher education with greater flexibility in curriculum and course options, so far, choosing science at higher secondary has been necessary for students who want to choose any of STEM courses at higher levels. Therefore, stream choice at this level determines the subsequent education trajectory and significantly impacts future labour market outcomes. In India, to redress the gender imbalances in STEM education within prestigious technical colleges, a recent policy reserves 20% of seats for female candidates. While policies like these focus on higher education, the decisions regarding academic paths are often made in earlier schooling years. From our studies, we find that female students are nearly 10 percentage points less likely to choose the science stream compared to boys. Considering that the overall proportion of students choosing science is around 40%, the magnitude of gender gap over the mean science participation rate is about 25%. Using the National Sample Survey (NSS) data across three rounds between 2007 and 2018, we find that this gender gap has remained persistent, with no significant change over the years. A potential reason why some students may not be able to choose science is that their performance in the grade 10 board exam may not be up to the mark. Students who do not have an aptitude for mathematics may also be discouraged from studying science. However, using the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) data, we find that the gender gap in science choice persists among boys and girls who performed equally well in the grade 10 board exam and had similar knowledge of mathematics (Sahoo and Klasen 2021). This indicates that differences in mathematics and science-related ability do not sufficiently explain the lower likelihood of girls choosing the science stream. Moreover, we find that even among boys and girls belonging to the same household, the gender gap is prevalent. Our study also provides evidence of persistent caste gaps in choosing science. We find that socially disadvantaged groups – Scheduled Tribes (ST), Scheduled Castes (SC), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) – have lower participation rates in science by 18, 12, and 8%, respectively, than the general caste on average. These estimates control for various household-level socioeconomic indicators, including monthly per capita consumption expenditure. Thus, they suggest that caste identities affect educational outcomes even after controlling for wealth or class-based disparities. We further find that female students from OBC and SC groups face a “double jeopardy” – that is to say, their gender and caste identities additively contribute to their challenges. We also examine how households’ economic status and the educational background of older members contribute to the existing caste and gender disparities. We find that the caste gaps, especially for SC and OBC, are significantly lowered when households’ consumption expenditure increases. Similarly, caste gaps reduce with increasing levels of education of the head of the household. However, neither higher household consumption nor higher education level lowers the gender gap. Thus, while a substantial increase in household affluence may potentially mitigate caste disparities, it is unlikely to affect the gender gap. Adding credence to this finding, our analysis further shows that while substantial parts of caste-based gaps can be explained by the differences in household’s socioeconomic status, the gender gaps cannot be explained by these differences. We further find that the availability of schools offering science stream at the higher-secondary level in the locality plays an important role in determining the stream choice for girls. Not all schools offer a science stream, and due to various reasons, including safety concerns, parents may be more opposed to sending their girls (compared to boys) to a faraway school. Parents might prefer to send their girls to a nearby school offering only humanities than a faraway school offering science. Controlling for the number of higher-secondary schools in a district, we find that when a higher proportion of schools offer science stream, the gender gap is significantly reduced. The availability of schools is not the only relevant factor. Research has shown that while there is no intrinsic gender difference in the mathematical capability of children, false beliefs prevail in society that boys are better than girls at mathematics (Kahn and Ginther 2017). A related study (Rakshit and Sahoo 2023) shows that even teachers hold such gender stereotypes. When girls are taught by such biased teachers, they may be discouraged from taking up science-related subjects. Such biases could also adversely affect the students of disadvantaged caste groups. Thus, the social identity of teachers who teach subjects such as mathematics and science in earlier grades could influence the stream choice of students in later years. We find that if students are taught mathematics or science subjects at the secondary level (grades 9 and 10) by teachers of matching social identity (that is, the same gender or caste), then the gender and caste-based disparities in science choice at the higher secondary level are lower. This could be due to teachers of the same social identity being less biased or serving as ‘role models’ for the students. India contributes to a large proportion of STEM graduates in the world. However, entry into STEM is not that straightforward – various socio-economic factors may influence individuals’ decision to choose to study science. Our research provides quantitative evidence on gender- and caste-based gaps in stream choice at the higher secondary level in India. From a policy perspective, our findings suggest that improving access to STEM education through the establishment of more schools offering science would particularly benefit girls and encourage them to pursue science. Increasing representation of teachers from SEDGs would also reduce social identity-based disparities in science take-up rates. Thus, taking social identity into account while formulating policies could help advance equal opportunities in STEM education.  Comments will be held for moderation.

| Photo Credit: File photo  Recognising the importance of the role of parents and community engagement in the success of students, the School Education Department has initiated a novel programme titled ‘Coffee with the education assistant’. As a part of this initiative, the Mandal Education Officers (MEOs) are encouraged to dedicate half a day to engage with each education assistant at the village and ward secretariats and explain to them various programmes launched by the government in the education sector and their benefits to the students. School Education Principal Secretary Praveen Prakash cited the example of the MEO of Chittoor mandal Selvaraj, who has visited all 60 villages and ward secretariats under his purview and spent significant time with each of them, talking about the enormous benefits of the flagship programmes of the government. “This, in turn, will greatly help the students of Chittoor mandal,” said Mr. Praveen Prakash. Referring to the school restructuring programme, as part of which high schools in Andhra Pradesh now start from Class 3, as opposed to the 6th grade in other States, he said all upper primary schools now had subject teacher posts. During his recent visit to Anantapur district, he observed that the guidelines were not being followed fully. He said the situation called for proper coordination between the government school teachers and their counterparts in municipal and Zilla Parishad schools. The Principal Secretary said the respective district Collectors should intervene to ensure that subject teachers were available in high schools, upper primary schools and primary schools, starting from the 3rd grade.

National Education Day: National Education Day is celebrated every year on November 11 across India to mark the birth anniversary of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad who was the first education minister of independent India. He served as the education minister from August 15, 1947 to February 2, 1958 and passed away in Delhi on February 22, 1958. Abul Kalam Ghulam Muhiyuddin Ahmed bin Khairuddin Al-Hussaini Azad was born on November 18, 1888. He was a freedom fighter, educationist, scholar and senior leader of the Indian National Congress. Also called Maulana Azad, he was a key architect of Independent India. He was responsible for setting up the top education bodies including the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and the University Grants Commission (UGC). Maulana Abul Kalam Azad also established the first Indian Institute of Technology – IIT Kharagpur. The Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), Sahitya Academy, Lalit Kala Academy, Sangeet Natak Academy and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) were also set up under his guidance. The National Education Day is observed to celebrate the work done by Abul Kalam Azad in the education sector during his lifetime. In post-independent India, Azad focused on areas including educating the rural poor and girls, adult literacy, free and compulsory for all children up to the age of 14, universal primary education, and diversification of secondary education and vocational training. To celebrate National Education Day, schools and colleges organise programmes, seminars and workshops. Various schools organise essays, speeches, poster making and many other competitions. Maulana Azad was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1992. Bharat Ratna is India’s highest civilian award.Navigating the Digital Classroom: Safeguarding Education through Data Security Measures
In recent times, education has undergone significant transformation due to technological advancement. Technology has played a disruptive role in catapulting education to digital platforms like online learning and virtual classrooms. Due to the commencement of digitalization, education has increased its outreach to far nooks and corners of the globe. Digital transformation has made education more accessible to students in remote areas. It has introduced new teaching methods and forms that make learning informative and exciting. However, there are certain disadvantages to the digitalization of education, like data privacy and security of students, cyber threats, etc. It is pivotal for educational institutes to meet the challenges of data security and privacy in education. Prevent Data Security Threat In digital education, student data is invaluable. Such data gives insights to educators about personalized styles of learning; it also helps create and introduce unique learning methodologies. However, students' data also consists of their personal information, which, if landed into the wrong hands, can cause immense harm. Educational institutes are a common target for data security threats like fishing. Every institute must sensitize its staff to types of data security threats to safeguard important data, especially student information, from phishing attacks. Incorporating Data Protection Measures It is pivotal to incorporate state-of-the-art digital security measures by educational institutes to safeguard data security. Digital tools like Zoom conferences, etc., can be misused by hackers and cyber thieves. Such barging can result in data theft and, worse, cyberbullying of the students. Strong data guidelines, such as collecting data that is not personalized and protecting the students' privacy, can help effectively in data security. It is essential that educators have an appropriate understanding of how to operate digital tools efficiently that can sieve any misuse by any data thief or cybercriminal. Laws and Regulations Governments around the globe have rolled out stringent regulations to prohibit any misuse of student data and privacy. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act 23 in India was created to safeguard personal information and privacy. Similarly, the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union has set strict guidelines for collecting and processing personal data. In the United States, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act protects the privacy of student education records. It is pertinent that educational institutes understand these laws and regulations to take necessary steps when required. Protecting Data through Encryption One of the most effective tools for data security is encryption. Encrypting the data protects data from being stolen, changed, or compromised and works by converting data into a secret code that can only be unlocked with a unique digital key. A good encryption is tough to break even for a seasoned cybercriminal. Encryption prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data, even if the breach occurs. Encryption not only safeguards data access but also protects data during transfer, protects the data over multiple devices and maintains data integrity. This helps to safeguard against attacks on student's privacy. Maintaining Ethical Standards while Collecting Data The data collection has immense benefits for creating effective educational outcomes. However, it is crucial that data collection must be done ethically. It is advisable to collect relevant data for the purpose it is needed. Do not collect sensitive or personal data from the students; this is a critical practice. Avoid using data for commercial use. Using personal data for commercialization without prior consent is unethical and an offence under the new regulations. Digitalization of education has added a significant milestone in the transformation of education. However, digitalization also brings its own set of data and privacy security issues. Educational institutes must invest in robust data security measures and tools to safeguard students from cyber threats, theft and crime. The educational institute must build a specific cyber security department to protect itself and its students from cyber threats. It is essential to sensitize and educate educators, students and parents about cyber threats and regulations by the government to prevent cyber-attacks.

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023 (NCF) integrates Vocation Education (VE) in the curriculum of Indian schools. Why? Because for most children, gainful employment after completing school is critical. Also, because even those who don’t need to earn their livelihood immediately after school are better prepared for life with the knowledge and capacities that VE develops. The NCF must confront three interrelated challenges for this integration. First, the practicality of how this will happen. Second, the societal view of VE being for those who cannot succeed in ‘mainstream’ education. Third, a ‘philosophical bias’ in Indian education against VE, which ranges from indifference to hostility. These are dealt by the NCF with the approach it takes to VE. But first, let’s take up the ‘philosophical bias’, because it is less known. The consensus among those who have led the intellectual direction of school education has been that schools must aim to develop good human beings, and with that a just and humane society and a vibrant democracy. Irrespective of differences within this consensus—for example, self-actualization versus citizenship—the ‘economic aims’ of education (preparing students for jobs) have systematically been de-prioritized. The assumption has been that all other learning will anyway prepare students for jobs; that VE is the thin end of the wedge for the ‘market’ to control education; and implicitly for many and explicitly for some, VE isn’t cerebral enough. This needs a separate confessional column because I too was guilty. So, how is VE integrated in the NCF? All students will go through VE from the very beginning of their schooling. In the Foundational and Preparatory Stages (till grade 5), age-appropriate capacities that are the basis of work—for example, safe control over a tool or concentration to see a task through to completion—are to be developed through play and other activities. In the Middle Stage of grades 6-8, exposure to a wide range of work will be given to all students through project-based study, building a foundation for a range of vocations. In grades 9-10, all students will learn a few specific vocations. Throughout the phase of grades 6 to 10, VE will have the same importance as subjects like Mathematics or Science, with equal space on time-tables and appropriate assessments, including board exams in grade 10. In grades 11-12, students can choose to specialize in a vocation or two or none. Effective VE requires effective education in other subjects: Language, Science, Social Science and Mathematics. Equally, these other subjects are strengthened by their use in VE. Vocational capacities must be deeply integrated with the other skills, knowledge and values that school education develops. For example, critical thinking, communication and learning-to-learn—capacities that overall school education must develop—are equally important in the world of work. The NCF balances two requirements. While it cannot determine which exact vocations must be taught in a particular school—because there are too many vocations and local considerations—it must provide a framework for all students. It does so by using a typology (‘forms of work’), grouping vocations that have fundamentally common elements and requiring similar capacities and knowledge. This develops a broad base for productive work from grades 3-8, with specialization in grades 9-12. The three categories are: work with life forms, work with materials and machines, and work on providing human services. The choice of specific vocation must be made locally, taking into account the aspirations of students, local relevance and the reality of opportunities (new and emerging vocations). The NCF’s approach to VE also has a few other important considerations. Vocations require not only relevant capacities, but also values and knowledge, all of which VE develops. VE must not be conflated with skills training, which is narrower. Capacities are broader, deeper and complex human abilities that many skills can constitute. For example, appropriate irrigation of crops is a capacity that requires the skills of reading slopes, trenching and constructing channels, and understanding how much and when to water. All students are to be exposed to the entire range of vocations, from the primary sector to various services, not only to create a base for subsequent vocation choices, but also to establish the dignity of all types of work. VE must teach students how to ‘do’ something with their hands and learn to value it. Millions of our children are already engaged in some kind of work in their homes and communities. Such life experiences are invaluable and can be used as a resource. Existing social inequities must be directly addressed. Schools must not identify types of work by specific communities or gender. Education must be an equalizer, not a reproducer of inequity. And VE must be implementable in the current reality of our schools, using existing resources available in the school and neighbourhood, including by training teachers of other subjects. Good school education must develop good human beings and a good society. Economic well-being is an inextricable part of that. The NCF gives this reality it’s rightful place in schools.

Listen to Story In India, the value given to physical learning and education has always been paramount, right from the Gurukul era to modern times. Today, in a world dominated by digital advancement, education has embraced the tech wave, reshaping how we learn. While screens and algorithms have become integral, the enduring essence of physical learning remains indispensable. Shammi Manik - CEO, of New Saraswati House - a national publication, has shared how traditional and physical learning helps students develop social skills, empathy, and teamwork.advertisementTHE IRREPLACEABLE ESSENCE OF PHYSICAL LEARNING Beyond the confines of pixels and code, physical learning plays a pivotal role in nurturing holistic growth and social development. Face-to-face interactions in classrooms forge interpersonal skills, shaping individuals into well-rounded personalities. The unspoken lessons learned during recess, group projects, and extracurricular activities are irreplaceable as they foster empathy and teamwork in students.BLENDED LEARNING APPROACHES Beyond the confines of pixels and code, physical learning plays a pivotal role in nurturing holistic growth and social development. Face-to-face interactions in classrooms forge interpersonal skills, shaping individuals into well-rounded personalities. The unspoken lessons learned during recess, group projects, and extracurricular activities are irreplaceable as they foster empathy and teamwork in students.BLENDED LEARNING APPROACHES A blend of traditional physical learning and digital tools is key to striking the perfect educational balance. Successful models showcase how technology enhances physical education rather than replacing it. Virtual labs, interactive simulations, and educational games complement traditional methods, creating a comprehensive learning experience. CHALLENGES IN THE EDTECH LANDSCAPE Despite these advantages, numerous challenges persist in the EdTech landscape, demanding thoughtful solutions. These challenges include- 1. Screen exhaustion Prolonged screen time poses a threat to students' well-being in India. According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Education, Indian students spend an average of 6 hours per day on screens, leading to eye strain and fatigue. Balancing digital and physical activities becomes crucial. Educators must incorporate screen-free breaks, outdoor activities, and hands-on projects to mitigate this negative impact. 2. Absence of peer interaction A virtual classroom often lacks the buzz of camaraderie found in traditional settings. Simulating peer engagement through online forums, physical classes, group projects, and virtual study groups can bridge this gap. 3. Student-teacher ratio Maintaining an effective student-teacher ratio is challenging, especially in digital classrooms. Leveraging technology to provide personalised feedback, virtual office hours, and peer-to-peer learning can help address this concern. This ensures that each student receives the attention they deserve, combining the benefits of both worlds.CONCLUDING THOUGHTS The digital age thus demands a delicate balance between the physical and the virtual when it comes to the educational realm. Integrating physical learning and digital tools is not a compromise but a synergy that ensures education remains dynamic, enriching, and inclusive. It's a balancing act that empowers students with diverse skill sets and prepares them for a future where adaptability is key. As we navigate this new frontier, let's not forget the power of a handshake, the joy of a shared project, and the wisdom gained from traditional physical learning.  After all, education is not just about acquiring knowledge but also achieving holistic growth as individuals and contributing meaningfully to society.Published By: Shruti BansalPublished On: Nov 9, 2023READ |  How heavy study curriculum affects students’ mental health | ExplainedREAD |  What is ethical advertising: Strategies for building trust in the digital ageAdvertisementAajtak Campus - Your College Search Partner!
Must WatchSingapore Institute of Management Global Education Explores Collaboration Opportunities with Schools and Higher Education Institutions in India
 Mediawire   New Delhi [India], November 10: In recent years, there has been a rising trend of Indian students seeking an overseas education, primarily because of the opportunity to receive quality education coupled with global exposure, to enhance career prospects, while experiencing a foreign culture. With a vision to help Indian students ‘Learn for Life and Thrive for Life’, the Singapore Institute of Management Global Education (SIM GE) is expanding its footprint in India by partnering with schools and Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) in India to provide its learners with transnational pathways and opportunities for international education. SIM GE has also set up Overseas Training Centres (OTCs) in India, to provide local students with learning opportunities that focus on being industry-focused, skills-based, and learner-centred. One of the OTCs in India was established in collaboration with Garodia International College (GIC), part of the Garodia Education Group, in Mumbai. Local learners can take on SIM’s Diploma in Management Studies programme at the OTC.   One of the HEIs that SIM GE has partnered with is the Jagannath Institute of Management School (JIMS) in Delhi. The partnership paves the way for student exchanges to SIM and allows academic credit transfers for modules completed at SIM GE to fulfil the requirements of their local education programme.   SIM’s education model also aligns with India’s emphasis on the Education 4.0 revolution to promote inclusive learning and increase employability. Apart from learning experiences, SIM GE is known for its vibrant student community, career coaching support, and a wide range of networking activities to help one develop professionally and build soft skills. These alone are huge criteria for Indian students to look at SIM GE for their education. The campus also boasts of a conducive and holistic environment for students to learn in.   Recently, as part of a tour organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), SIM GE hosted a delegation of over 45 School Management Owners and Directors from India, where potential collaborations were also discussed.   Having attended the tour, Dr Rajesh Pankaj, Director and Head, Education and Skills, at FICCI said, “The visit of FICCI ARISE Delegation to SIM was an enriching experience. SIM’s flexible framework to promote quality education will go a long way in effectively augmenting internationalisation of education and providing students a rich academic experience.”   With more than 10 globally recognised university partners, SIM GE offers more than 120 academic programmes, ranging from diplomas and graduate diploma programmes to bachelor’s and master’s degree programmes with some of the world’s most reputable universities from Australia, Europe, United Kingdom and the United States. Some of these university partners include the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, University of London, University of Birmingham, RMIT, University of Wollongong, and more. Students are also offered the opportunity to visit their university partners overseas as part of their exchange programme. Some courses popular among Indian students are Business Management, Accounting, and Finance, Data Sciences, Business Analytics, Computing, AI, Big Data, International Business, and Fashion, Design and Luxury Management.   SIM GE has been active in India for about 14 years and has churned out about 1,100 Indian alumni to date. They work closely with reputable local schools and institutions for their outreach events, such as the SIM GE Annual Educators Conference held in Singapore. The conference is attended by top Indian school career counsellors every year and is well-appreciated.   SIM GE is ideal for students looking for a quality education overseas but is still closer to home. Through its Transnational Education (TNE) model, SIM GE enables Indian students to leverage a single institution to access opportunities to pursue global education programmes from top-ranked universities.   SIM GE believes in taking a unique approach towards education so that learners are empowered to thrive throughout life.

pillars of our communities, and cornerstones of our democracy.  We recommit to investing in all the schools, educators, and staff — the kite strings that keep our national ambitions aloft.     A great education opens doors and changes lives.  From our astronauts, artists, scientists, and software developers to our engineers, entrepreneurs, manufacturers, and medical professionals, countless Americans first discovered their potential in our public schools.  Many further honed their talents in our universities, community colleges, Registered Apprenticeship programs, and career and technical education programs.  That is what makes our Nation one of possibilities:  Here in the United States everyone has the chance to learn, grow, and pursue their dreams, no matter who they are or where they grew up.  But there is more we can still do to ensure every child has a fair shot.  Despite heroic efforts by our Nation’s teachers, the pandemic further deepened existing achievement gaps after years of flat or declining achievement in math and reading nationwide.      That is why my Administration has secured a historic $130 billion for America’s K-12 schools.  This funding has put more teachers in our classrooms and more counselors, social workers, and other staff in our schools.  Additionally, this funding is providing high-quality tutoring, supporting record expansions of summer and after-school programming, improving air quality in schools, addressing environmental and safety needs in aging school buildings, and creating other critical initiatives designed to support our students.  We also recognize that our students cannot thrive at school unless they are healthy and safe.  The American Rescue Plan also made our country’s biggest-ever investment in mental health and substance use programs, supplying the resources to recruit, train, and support more providers at the State and local levels — including in our schools.  I also signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law — the first major Federal gun safety legislation passed in nearly 30 years, getting us closer to a world where every school in America is free from the threat of gun violence.  This legislation also included historic levels of funding to address youth mental health, including $2 billion to create safe, inclusive learning environments for students and hire and train more mental health professionals for schools, which is where students are most likely to receive these crucial services.  My Administration also released a national strategy to end hunger and reduce diet-related diseases in America by 2030 — including by advancing a pathway to provide free, healthy school meals for all children.        We are fighting for our youngest learners too.  We know that if we start early in both reading and math and make kindergarten a sturdy bridge between the early years and early grades, we set the stage for their lasting academic success.  In fact, providing America’s children with a strong foundation during their first 5 years can form the basis for lifelong health and well-being as well as achievement in education and their future careers.  I will continue to press for high-quality, free preschool for all three- and four-year-olds.     My Administration also secured nearly $40 billion for colleges and universities in the American Rescue Plan.  Importantly, we have invested billions of dollars in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority Serving Institutions, such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions.  I have made it a priority to make college more affordable for Americans, and have worked with the Congress to increase the maximum Pell Grant by $900 since the beginning of my Administration, helping over 6 million eligible students pay for school.  Further, my Administration has approved $127 billion in student loan debt relief for nearly 3.6 million borrowers — more than any President in history.  We have also fixed the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that borrowers who go into public service, including public school teachers, get the debt relief they have earned.  Borrowers who work in public service can apply for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program at www.studentaid.gov/pslf.  Our SAVE plan, once fully implemented, will make student loan repayment more affordable than ever before, slashing payments to $0 for borrowers who earn less than about $15 an hour, saving them over $1,000 a year, and ending the runaway student loan interest responsible for ballooning balances.  Enrolling in SAVE takes less than 10 minutes.     While we are making historic investments in colleges and universities, we also believe that every person in our Nation deserves access to the American Dream, whether they have a college degree or not.  That is why we have invested more in Registered Apprenticeships and technical career training programs than any administration in history.  These programs empower workers to earn while they learn and offer them a path toward good-paying jobs.  In addition, the Departments of Education and Labor are collaborating to expand Registered Apprenticeships for educators.  To help raise a new generation of talented educators from underrepresented backgrounds, we are working to increase high-quality teacher preparation programs and strengthen and diversify the teacher pipeline.     During American Education Week, we recognize the critical role education plays in realizing the defining creed of our Nation — that we are a land of possibilities.  We celebrate all the dedicated educators, school counselors, nurses, bus drivers, security guards, custodians, cafeteria workers, and other school staff, who keep our schools running and support our students’ health, safety, and success.  Together, we will ensure that every student has the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.     NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 12 through November 18, 2023, as American Education Week.  I call upon all Americans to mark this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities honoring those who devote their talents and energies to helping our children reach their full potential and to building school communities where all students feel they belong.     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of November, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR. We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

News The event took inspiration from the 2021 report of the International Commission on the Futures of Education, with the aim of developing a shared vision of a new social contract for education in the region. It was co-organized by the Arab Network for National Human Rights Institutions, the Arab Institute for Human Rights, the League of Arab States, the Office of the United Nations High, the Commissioner for Human Rights, the National Council for Human Rights in Egypt, and UNESCO. Some 150 participants – representatives of ministries of education, regional experts and representatives of regional and international organizations – joined the Arab Regional Dialogue Forum to explore particular challenges facing the Arab region.  The forum particularly focused on the integration of human rights education in pedagogical approaches and in the management of educational institutions, with the overall objective of outlining a new social contract for education in the Arab region. The event took place against the backdrop of the tragic developments in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Research Specialist from UNESCO’s Future of Learning and Innovation Division, Elena Toukan, outlined the main principles and recommendations in the “Reimagining our Futures Together: a new social contract for education” report. She highlighted that “reimagining education depends on building a new social contract for education that can repair past injustices while transforming the future. It requires a reinvestment and a recommitment to those shared principles that will lead us towards sustainable, peaceful, and just futures – centering the right to education as a common good and a shared endeavor. This involves examining how learning is organized – the design of our education systems, how we organize schools, universities and all the places and times that educational opportunities are present.” In addition to presenting the content of the report, Dr. Toukan also shared how its messages have been taken up worldwide since its release two years ago. The report has been officially translated into over 15 languages, sparking national and regional-level dialogue. The Futures of Education Report has been a key reference for high-level education policy fora, including the 2022 Transforming Education Summit at the UN, over 120 policy and/or research events organized around the world, and has inspired  new avenues for research proposals and dialogue in schools and universities around the world. On the first day of the forum, several plenary sessions addressed important topics related to education, the role of educational institutions, and their contribution to enhancing human rights education within curricula, ensuring justice and equality for all. It featured presentations from each of the 16 countries represented, including Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Tunisia. The participation of civil society organizations alongside ministry representatives, enriched and widened dialogue on numerous dimensions of education, including lifelong learning, gender equality, education in refugee contexts, and the impacts of conflict and climate change. The Second day was dedicated to working group sessions, presenting over a dozen working papers on crucial issues for the futures of education. Rapporteurs in each session consolidated ideas, presenting a collection of 22 key recommendations arising from the two days of dialogue involving all of the Forum’s participants. This forum built on an earlier regional seminar "The Futures of Education in the Arab Countries: Policies, Approaches, and Directions for Action” organized in May 2022 by the Arab Institute for Human Rights, and which was followed by a series of regional consultations on the futures of education to conceptualize a new social contract for education in Arab countries. This latest Forum is a key milestone for regional stakeholders to deepen dialogue on the integration of human rights education, as an integral part of renewing the social contract for education adapted to needs within the Arab States region.How tax deductions make education loans attractive
Higher education is a costly affair, especially if your child decides to pursue a professional course or opts to study abroad. It is also one of the key financial goals of most parents, many of who start investing for this soon after the births of their children. Such investments, made either in real estate, stocks, mutual funds or fixed deposits, are usually liquidated at the time of college admissions. To be sure, students can avail of an education loan which they can repay later on getting a job. Yet, many parents tend to self-finance this major expense from their investments accumulated thus far, rather than burdening their children with loans. Experts, however, caution against this trend and say that education loans help from a returns and taxation point of view. “If you can deploy your savings astutely, your corpus can give you better returns than the total interest outgo on an education loan. Moreover, the annual interest payment makes you eligible for tax deduction," says Anurag Jain, co-founder and partner at ByTheBook Consulting LLP . That is exactly what Delhi-based Ankit Mehra (38) did. He was 28 years old when he decided to pursue an MBA from IESE Business School, Barcelona, in August 2013 and needed more than  ₹50 lakh for his studies. Mehra had a rich stock portfolio, besides a property in Delhi-NCR that he could have sold off to pay for his studies. “I opted for an education loan because I felt that my corpus would fetch me returns that would negate what I had to pay as the interest on the education loan," says Mehra, who is now co-founder and CEO of GyanDhan, an education financing marketplace. Some parents, though, want their children to learn financial discipline while doing their studies. Kulwant Singh Kalra, for example, self-financed the first-year course fee for his son who is studying culinary management in Canada. “The work culture in Canada allows students to take up part-time jobs for a few hours every week. I want my son to earn and save for his education fee next year onwards. I am always there to chip in if there is an issue but he must take on that financial responsibility right away," he says. No cap on tax deductionExperts say opting for an education loan has other advantages. For instance, section 80E of Income Tax Act allows you to claim tax deduction on the interest component of the education loan EMI without any upper limit. Moreover, one can claim it for a maximum of eight financial years after the repayment begins. Notably, principal payment doesn’t offer any tax relief.

     
      To illustrate this better, let’s take the hypothetical case of Ravi, who is in the 30% income tax slab rate and needs  ₹1 crore to fund the higher education of his child. He can liquidate his stock portfolio for this purpose. However, he chooses to take an education loan for a tenure of 8 years to reduce his tax liability. Ravi will pay  ₹51.57 lakh as interest in the course of 8 years on the education loan (see graphic). However, he can save  ₹15.47 lakh in taxes cumulatively during this period. Meanwhile, his  ₹1 crore stock portfolio, assuming a CAGR of 10%, would grow to  ₹2.14 crore.

      Financial experts say it is better if the loan instalments are paid by the parents. The person paying the EMIs will be eligible to claim section 80-E tax deduction. “We advise our clients that parents should avail of this benefit because their tax liability will be higher than their child who has just started the job," Jain says.

Know your risk-appetiteThough financial experts ask their clients to avoid taking on debt, they also let you know that some loans are productive. “I tell my clients to avoid all debts except the home and education loans. The repayment is structured in a way that it benefits the borrower," says Jain.

     
      However, risk-appetite comes first. Thus, Mehra of GyanDhan, decided to pay off his education loan first before he decided to launch his startup. “I felt the need to minimize my risk exposure in other areas. I started selling off my investments in the stock market and finalized the sale of my property in Delhi-NCR. Once I moved back to India in May 2015, I consolidated all my finances, and paid off the entire loan in one go, says Mehra.

Consider ancillary costsParents also need to take into account ancillary costs that take care of living expenses of their wards who study abroad. Kumar Vishal Singh, a resident of Noida, says he recently secured admission for his son Krish Singh to the four-year B.Tech (Hons) course in Mechatronics from Sydney University, and wanted to part-pay the  ₹1 crore fees. However, he needed to maintain at least  ₹30 lakh in his bank account for his son’s visa process. He then secured a  ₹1.2 crore loan from a private sector bank at an interest rate of 9.25%. The monthly EMIs came in at  ₹1.44 lakh. “One needs to have enough funds in the bank account that can take care of other education expenses such as hostel, food, books and travel. This is why I preferred to hold on to my savings and take an education loan. Moreover, loan EMIs help me claim deductions that reduces my tax liability," says Singh.

     
      Those opting to study abroad need to take into consideration the tax collected at source (TCS), effective 1 October. Any foreign transaction beyond a threshold of  ₹7 lakh per financial year per individual will attract TCS at the rate of 20%, with an exception in education and medical transactions. In case of education, TCS shall be applicable beyond  ₹7 lakh at 0.5% (if remittance for education is financed by education loan) or 5% (in case it is self-financed). So, if you are sending  ₹1 crore to a foreign university, and assuming there is no other foreign remittance, the bank will collect tax on  ₹93 lakh (see graphic). Since this is advance tax, you can get it back as a refund when you file your income tax return.

The moratoriumTypically, banks offer students a loan repayment holiday while they are studying, which is called moratorium period. It lasts for the duration of the course and is extended by about 12 months afterwards. Students do not have to pay EMIs during this moratorium, but interest is calculated right after the loan is disbursed. “As per Model Education Loan Scheme by the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA), banks are required to levy simple interest on the loan amount (if the foreign education loan amount is up to  ₹20 lakh) during moratorium period. This amount gets added to the principal and EMI is calculated accordingly when the repayment starts," says Adhil Shetty, CEO and co-founder of BankBazaar. Some private banks may levy compound interest during this period. Financial planners say that borrowers should pay off the interest portion during the moratorium period to avoid additional interest outflows. “Those who service the interest component during moratorium period can get 1% interest concession as per IBA provision," says Shetty.

Listen to Story Over the past decade, the landscape of education in India has experienced a remarkable and unprecedented transformation. The methods of teaching, which were once characterised by conventional and time-honoured pedagogical approaches, have undergone substantial evolution to meet the dynamic demands of a rapidly changing world. This article seeks to delve into the key shifts that have not only defined but have also significantly refined the teaching practices of the last ten years, illustrating how these transformations have deeply impacted the broader educational sector of the country. Dr Maithili Tambe, CEO of The Academy School (TAS), Pune has shared how teaching has evolved in the last ten years.advertisementINTEGRATION OF TECHNOLOGY Arguably one of the most remarkable and resounding changes in the realm of education is the seamless infusion of technology into traditional classrooms.The erstwhile blackboard has made way for interactive smartboards, while online collaboration tools, educational applications, and even virtual reality simulations have redefined the way students engage with educational content. PERSONALISED LEARNING APPROACHES Arguably one of the most remarkable and resounding changes in the realm of education is the seamless infusion of technology into traditional classrooms. The erstwhile blackboard has made way for interactive smartboards, while online collaboration tools, educational applications, and even virtual reality simulations have redefined the way students engage with educational content. PERSONALISED LEARNING APPROACHES The conventional 'one-size-fits-all' teaching approach has gradually given way to meticulously personalised learning experiences. Acknowledging the intrinsic diversity in students' learning preferences and paces, educators now harness the potential of adaptive learning platforms and data-driven analyses. EMPHASIS ON ACTIVE LEARNING STRATEGIES A paradigm shift is observable in teaching methodologies, with the archaic memorisation-focused approach being systematically replaced by dynamic active learning strategies. Collaborative group projects, experiential problem-solving tasks, and immersive hands-on experiences have seamlessly become integral components of the modern-day learning process. GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES AND INTERNATIONALISM In an era defined by unparalleled interconnectedness, the integration of global perspectives within education has assumed an undeniable significance. Students are now regularly exposed to a rich tapestry of diverse cultures, significant world events, and pressing international issues. Initiatives such as virtual exchange programmes and cross-cultural collaborations further amplify this facet of education, cultivating a generation of informed and culturally sensitive global citizens.EMPOWERING PARENT-TEACHER COLLABORATION The conventional model of parent-teacher interactions has metamorphosed into a collaborative partnership. Consistent and constructive communication, coupled with active parental involvement in a child's educational journey, has been empirically demonstrated to positively influence both academic performance and overall well-being.  The remarkable evolution of teaching methodologies in India over the last decade underscores a progressive shift towards learner-centric, technology-imbued, and globally aware education. The deliberate adoption of these transformative practices not only enhances the learning experience but also strategically equips students with the multifaceted skill set requisite for navigating an ever-evolving world.

Must WatchHow EduFi Hopes To Help Pakistani Students Extend Their Education
EduFi founder and CEO Aleena Nadeem Pakistan has a problem: it is struggling to keep its young people in education, largely because so many families cannot manage the upfront costs of college fees. Enter fintech startup EduFi, which is today announcing the successful completion of a $6.1 million fundraising round. It hopes its innovative approach to student loans could drive up participation rates in higher and further education in the country. “This is a product that doesn’t currently exist,” says Aleena Nadeem, CEO and founder of the business, which was launched in 2021. “The only alternative until now for families who need to borrow to pay education costs has been expensive commercial loans.” EduFi's solution is different. It partners with education providers so they can offer students access to finance as they enrol on courses and as fees fall due. So far, the business has signed up 14 colleges from across Pakistan, which currently offer education to 200,000 students, but Nadeem hopes to extend the idea across the whole of Pakistan’s college system through an agreement with the Government. The idea effectively came from colleges themselves. Nadeem explains. “Lots of colleges told us their students had asked if they could pay fees month by month, rather than in one go at the beginning of the year or term, but these are education providers rather than banks,” she says. “By partnering with us, that’s exactly what they can now offer.” From a business perspective, the idea works very well, with EduFi effectively getting exclusive access to a captive audience of potential borrowers; that lowers the company’s cost of customer acquisition very markedly. Some of that saving can then be returned to students. EduFi charges an annual equivalent rate of 29% on its loans, undercutting the cost of bank loans by a significant margin. Students and their families take out the loans when their fees fall due, paying back the money through monthly repayments; effectively, it’s a way to spread the cost of college fees that might otherwise be unaffordable. Not every student is guaranteed a loan. EduFi has developed a new credit scoring model it uses to vet applications. This model considers applicants’ bank statements, but also looks at their educational record – students with poor grades and attendance, for example, are less likely to be offered finance since EduFi thinks they are more likely to drop out of college and default on loan repayments. Adding these additional criteria to the credit scoring model has required EduFi to build a technology platform capable of connecting with the systems of participating colleges so that student data can be extracted. But Nadeem believes this work has been important in reducing EduFi’s non-performing loan rates. “That has helped us to keep costs down and to offer finance without requesting any collateral,” she says. The technology also enables the business to process loan applications much more quickly than many conventional lenders. Students apply for finance via EduFi's mobile app, with the lender than able to offer a decision and release the funds within 48 hours. For Nadeem, the business obviously has exciting commercial potential, but she also believes it can be an important driver of social mobility. “I’ve spent the last nine years working at a charity that supports the poorest students through college, but there is a whole class of students who are above the poverty level but who still can’t afford further education,” she says. “We think EduFi can be a trigger for change in the lives of people as we lift one of the biggest burdens on aspiring families.” Certainly, there is no shortage of demand. Data from Unesco reveals that families in Pakistan spend an average of 57% of their income on children’s education – the equivalent of $14 billion a year. Investors are on board with the mission too. Today’s pre-seed funding round is led by Zayn Venture Capital, with participation from Palm Drive Capital, Deem Ventures Ltd, Q Business and a number of angel investors. At Zayn, general partner and founder Faisal Aftab shares Nadeem’s vision of creating a profitable business that also drives social good. “This is a significant step towards achieving financial inclusion for middle and low-income families,” Aftab says. “In Pakistan, families are spending more than half of their income on their children's education, which has become increasingly challenging due to inflationary pressures. EduFi's innovative approach will help alleviate this burden and empower families to invest in their children's future.”Specials schools will be made centres of excellence, says Education Minister

This bold endeavour aims to address the critical need for elevating the quality of education and ensuring access to top-notch educational resources for students across the state. The selection process for identifying these institutions has already kicked off, with a primary focus on optimizing the learning environment for students. The first phase of this ambitious project will establish 500 primary, 200 middle, 200 high, and 200 senior secondary schools as Institutes of Excellence, with additional institutions being identified in the subsequent year. The core principle of this program is an unwavering commitment to maintaining high educational standards. If any of the selected schools or colleges fail to meet the stringent criteria set forth, their status as Institutes of Excellence will be withdrawn, ensuring a system of accountability and continuous improvement. To ensure that students receive a comprehensive and high-quality education, the initial phase will see Excellence Primary Schools being augmented with five new teachers. Middle, high, and senior secondary schools will appoint teachers for each subject, guaranteeing a specialized and holistic learning experience. The selection of schools in the first phase will prioritize those with sufficient infrastructure and student seating capacity, emphasizing the importance of providing a conducive learning environment. Crucially, school principals will be entrusted with upholding and enhancing educational standards to maintain the coveted status of an Institute of Excellence. These institutions will undergo annual evaluations to ensure they continually deliver on their promise of excellence. Any failure to demonstrate improved performance could lead to the revocation of their excellence status. In an effort to establish clear benchmarks for educational excellence, the government has formed working groups to develop and set standards for these institutions. Reports from these groups are expected to be submitted this month, laying the foundation for the future of education in Himachal Pradesh. Separate working groups have also been constituted to determine standards for colleges, ensuring that improvements are seen across all levels of education in the state. Education Secretary Rakesh Kanwar has expressed optimism that a comprehensive proposal, detailing the framework for this initiative, will be prepared and submitted to the government for approval in the near future.U of A to Celebrate International Education Week Nov. 13-17

Follow Us On November 17, 2023, voters in Madhya Pradesh will exercise their right to suffrage. Amid the high stakes political action, both Congress and BJP are prepped up to take on each other for the throne of MP. Madhya Pradesh is considered to be a low-performing state in terms of poverty alleviation and per capita income. Often included in the acronym 'BIMARU', MP is largely an agrarian state with many of its young working population migrating to other states in search of greener pastures. Here, we'll deep dive and discuss about how Madhya Pradesh performs in the crucial sectors of employment, healthcare, and education. Employment Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in a poll rally held in September promised the people of MP that if BJP retains power in the state once again, it would ensure that each household has at least one job. "I will remove difficulties from the lives (of the people of the state). If elected to power again, one person from every family will be given employment so that they do not have to migrate. Be it through self-help groups, Udyam Kranti Yojana or government jobs, one person from every family will be given a job," Chouhan said. However, last year's economic survey of Madhya Pradesh tells a different tale altogether. The survey, presented right before the annual state budget, showed that both unemployment and debt are increasing in MP. In 2020, the number of unemployed in Madhya Pradesh was 24.7 lakh. This went up to 30.23 lakh a year later. Also, as per Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) data-2022, Unemployment rate in Madhya Pradesh is 3.2 per cent. Healthcare Madhya Pradesh has 1,155 primary health centres, 52 district hospitals, and 333 community health centres, and around 8,860 sub-centres. Having said that, MP has been identified by the National Health Mission as a high focus state. The state has one of the poorest child and maternal health indicators in the country. Education As per 2011 census, the literacy rate of Madhya Pradesh stands at 69.32 per cent against the national average of 72.98 per cent. According to 2009-10 data, MP has 105,592 primary schools, 6,352 high schools, and 5,161 higher secondary schools. It has 208 architecture and engineering colleges and as many management institutes along with 12 medical colleges. Madhya Pradesh boasts of being home to some of the premier educational institutes in India like: IIT Indore, IIM Indore, MANIT, IIFM, AIIMS Bhopal, NLIU Bhopal etc. With both BJP and Congress promising tons of schemes and sops to the voters of Madhya Pradesh this poll season, it'll be interesting to see which way the votes swing this time.Biden-Harris Administration Convenes Higher Education Leaders to Improve Student Transfer to Increase Completion of College Degrees
As part of its Raise the  Bar: Attaining College Excellence and Equity initiative, the U.S. Department of Education is hosting a summit today at Northern  Virginia Community College (NOVA) in Annadale, Virginia with 200 higher education leaders on  making it easier for students to transfer from one college to another, in turn  helping them save time and money. The Department is also releasing groundbreaking new data showing  which two- and four-year institutions are best promoting transfer students’  success and highlighting the most productive transfer partnerships between community college and bachelors’  degree institutions in the country. The difficulty  students face in transferring between colleges is one of the most significant  obstacles to helping many more students earn college degrees. While nearly  40% of students transfer at some point along their postsecondary journeys,  they lose more than 40% of their credits on average when they move between  schools. This costs students time, money, and too often the credentials they  seek to earn. As part of the response  to the Supreme Court decision in Students for Fair Admissions, the Biden-Harris  Administration emphasized in a White House meeting with  college presidents and a report on strategies to  increase diversity and opportunity in higher education the importance of  supporting community college transfer students. Given that many students of  color and students with low incomes start their higher learning at community  colleges, improving transfer pipelines from two-year to four-year colleges is a key strategy that states  and institutions can consider as they commit to missions of greater diversity. “If we want to  Raise the Bar for educational attainment in this country and create more  equitable outcomes in higher education, then we need leaders to dramatically  level up their support for transfer students,” said U.S. Secretary of Education  Miguel Cardona. “Our current higher education system stacks the deck against  community college students who aspire to earn four-year degrees—denying  acceptance of their credits, forcing them to retake courses, and ultimately  making their educational journeys longer and costlier than they need to be. In  the wake of a Supreme Court decision that threatens to undermine diversity and  equal opportunity in higher education, the Biden-Harris Administration believes  that fixing our broken approach to transfer in this country, which  disproportionately impacts students of color and other underserved students,  has never mattered more.” The Department also  released today groundbreaking new data on transfers  that spotlights the top two-year and four-year institutional partnership in each state.  Despite the large number of transfer students, there has been little public  data on how well particular colleges serve them. Among those top-performing  partnerships is NOVA, the host institution for the event, and George Mason  University (GMU). Thirteen  percent of new federally aided students who enroll at NOVA earn bachelor’s degrees  from GMU within eight years, reflecting a high transfer rate between the two  institutions and a strong graduation rate after transfer. The Department’s  research also found that this partnership is an important factor in the high  rate at which Virginia community college students go on to earn bachelor’s  degrees, compared to other states. The data also identified other strong  partnerships such as Irvine Valley College with California State  University-Fullerton (13%), Heartland Community College with Illinois State  University (13%), and the Tri-County Technical College with Clemson University (20%). The summit includes  teams of institutional and state representatives from 11 states from across the  country: California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York,  South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. At the convening, participants  will make commitments to support effective state transfer policy, institutional  transfer policy and practice, transfer student advising and navigation, and  data- and technology-enabled transfer solutions. “At today’s summit, the Biden-Harris Administration will  not only uplift successful efforts for promoting transfer student success, but  also release new data on transfer outcomes across institutions that we hope  will help leaders build a more accessible and inclusive higher education  system,” said Assistant Secretary of Postsecondary Education Nasser  Paydar. Participants in the summit will also discuss their  initiatives and commitments to improving transfer. Mildred Garcia,  Chancellor of the California State University said, “As the first Latina  chancellor of the nation’s largest and most diverse four-year university system  – half a million students strong – I thank Secretary Cardona for his visionary  leadership in advancing educational excellence and equity. These values are the  CSU’s values, and we are committed to strengthening transfer pathways to  provide increased educational opportunities for the future diverse leaders who  will drive California’s social and economic prosperity.” “While 80% of community college students intend to  transfer, fewer than 20% make it to a four-year institution and complete a  bachelor’s degree. It’s imperative that higher education works together to help  these students who are disproportionately first generation, low-income, working  parents, and students of color—complete the transfer process, graduate, and  enter the workforce. I am honored to be part of this summit to learn new  approaches that support transfer student success,” said Joe Garcia, Chancellor  of the Colorado Community College System. The transfer summit is part of the Department’s Raise the Bar: Attaining College  Excellence and Equity initiative. Raise the Bar seeks to uplift  colleges committed to inclusivity, equity, and excellence, rather than  arbitrary rankings, high costs, and privilege. Raise the Bar encourages state  and institutional leaders to ensure students of all backgrounds can earn a  college degree or certificate and go on to a better life. Building on this year’s summits on data-driven  improvement and transfer students, next year the Department will convene  leaders to address holistic advising and wraparound services and  career-relevant learning pathways in order to help more institutions increase  completion rates, close completion gaps, and ensure all students are earning  completions of value that lead to economic opportunity.

By Devin Watkins The De La Salle University in the Philippine capital of Manila held an international conference on 8-9 November, bringing together experts and university students to explore various aspects of service-learning. The IV Global Symposium Uniservitate was held in collaboration with the Australian Catholic University, and drew inspiration from the Global Compact on Education launched by Pope Francis. The Pope sent a letter of encouragement and gratitude, which was read out at the event on Thursday. In his message, Pope Francis noted that the Symposium brought together rectors, professors, and university students with the goal of sharing their experiences and research in the field of service-learning. He expressed his hope that the event might instill in young people a “greater awareness of the relationship that should exist between the ‘languages’ of the mind, the heart, and the hands.” “In this way, educators can form—and not simply inform—those entrusted to their care, so that all can learn to think in harmony with what they feel and do; feel in harmony with what they think and do and do it in harmony with what they feel and think,” he explained. Pope Francis advocated for an integral approach to education, so that young people can become leaders in building a better future for our global society. He also recalled the importance of the spiritual dimension in education. “I trust that the efforts of the Symposium,” he said, “will enhance the zeal of all taking part to serve the common good as missionary disciples, capable of bringing the transformative truth, beauty and joy of the Gospel to all in the human family, thus advancing God's kingdom of fraternal solidarity, justice and peace.” In conclusion, the Pope assured Symposium participants of his prayers and encouraged their continued work in education with his Apostolic Blessing. The Pope's AgendaEvery learner matters: Disability inclusion and gender equality in education
Event Eliminating barriers to education and creating accessible and inclusive learning environments have been long-standing objectives of both UNESCO and Plan International. This commitment is further addressed by the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development with its rights-based vision of leaving no one behind while emphasizing the need to reach the furthest behind first. The inclusion of learners with disabilities in education demands going beyond access to schooling and adequate infrastructure: it is also a matter of assuring their participation, learning, progression and attainment, providing accessible learning materials and resources, creating safe, friendly and accessible environments, ensuring teachers and other school staff are adequately trained and supported, and working with schools and communities to tackle bullying, stigma and discrimination. The intersection of gender with disability, acts as a magnifier resulting in further education deprivation. It is fundamental to have an intentional focus on inclusion in education and to tackle the root causes of exclusion, including inequality in the distribution of resources and power and the social and gender norms that perpetuate difference. The purpose of the webinar is to Key webinar themes The webinar will discuss disability and gender inequality as intersecting challenges to education. It will also address key topics as comprehensive sexuality education (CSE), bullying and violence, school health and nutrition. Target audiences Ministry of education staff, education practitioners and educators; researchers and experts; bilateral, multilateral and other development partners; private sector stakeholders; representatives of youth organizations; representatives of organizations of persons with disabilities; youth/learners with disabilities; representatives of parents and teachers; and representatives of inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations supporting inclusive education. Languages The webinar will be available in English, French and Spanish with International Sign Language interpretation.

    This article was originally delivered to subscribers of our Education Watch newsletter. Sign up now to receive Education Watch directly in your inbox. Jennifer Wilkinson is frantically trying to save Insight School of Oklahoma, the state’s only online alternative school. Wilkinson found out last week the state Education Department is pursuing new rules that would require alternative education to be delivered in-person. That would upend Insight’s model, which is entirely virtual. The proposed rules would require any alternative education program to be in-person, with both students and teachers physically on site. “It would eliminate our students’ equitability in education and being able to serve them in this model,” said Wilkinson, who has led Insight since 2019. In a statement accompanying the proposal, the Education Department said the changes would improve the quality of alternative education, align with best practices and comply with changes in law from 2019. Alternative education serves students who are at-risk of dropping out. Often, they are facing challenges such as mental health issues, substance abuse, pregnancy or parenting. Schools receive additional funding for alternative education. Insight has about 1,100 students in 6th through 12th grades. One aspect that sets Insight apart is its scheduling, which gives high school students the ability complete 4 to 6 classes per trimester block, allowing them to catch up on credits. Insight’s 4-year graduation rate is one of the lowest in the state, at 46% in 2022, according to its state School Report Card. Wilkinson said the rate has improved, and last year they had 220 graduates. A public hearing on the proposed changes is planned for 1:30 p.m. Nov. 15 at the state Education Department.

People are being asked to share their views to create a new national qualifications body and new approaches to inspection, as part of reforms to Scotland’s education and skills system. Legislation will be introduced to Parliament in 2024 to implement the Scottish Government's commitment to replace the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) with a new organisation. Views are now being sought on how this new body will involve pupils and students and the teaching professions in its decision making, as well as being accountable and transparent. The public consultation on reform of the education and skills sector is also seeking views on changes in relation to inspection, which currently sits with Education Scotland - to maximise the positive impacts of inspection and ensure high levels of confidence in the system among teachers, other professionals, parents and carers and the public. It was announced during a wide ranging statement on Education and Skills reform where Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth also announced the publication of the third report from the First Minister’s International Council of Education Advisers, which sets out the need for investment in education professionals to address the changing needs of young people. The Education Secretary also gave an update on planning for the proposed Centre for Teaching Excellence. Ms Gilruth said: "The case for reform is clear and we need to deliver tangible action, setting out the steps which are right for our education system now. “This consultation is an important opportunity for young people, parents and carers and, crucially, teachers to make their voices heard and is an important step in designing our national education and skills landscape in its totality. “The new qualifications body and approaches to inspection are the foundations of delivering meaningful reform, meaning better outcomes for young people and adult learners, ensuring that the views and needs of pupils, teachers and others who rely on this service are at the heart of what they do, and how they deliver support. “I am determined to continue to build the consensus for change. We need the system to work better for children and young people as well as the profession, ensuring it continues to support everyone to positively contribute to our country.” Background Read the Education Secretary’s statement to the Scottish Parliament. The consultation runs until 18 December 2023 and the proposed Education Bill will be introduced later this Parliamentary year. Read the First Minister’s International Council of Education Adviser’s third report. The Education Secretary will also chair a ministerial group on Education and Skills reform to ensure there are new, robust governance arrangements in place to support the delivery of reform with the professional advice of teachers and practitioners at the centre. A report by Professor Kenneth Muir on the replacement of the SQA and reform of Education Scotland was published in March 2022. It recommended the establishment of a revised national infrastructure to simplify the education landscape and to ensure that all teachers and practitioners have greater clarity on the roles and functions of the national bodies. The latest consultation is part of a wider programme of reform Scotland’s education and skills sector and follows publication by Professor Louise Hayward in October 2022 of a review of qualifications and assessments in Scotland, as well as a review of the skills delivery landscape by James Withers published in August 2022. Ms Gilruth also set out that Mr Dey would provide a further update to Parliament on plans for post school reform.

These causes are commonly called ‘the social determinants of health’. Achieving greater equity in health will demand that the health sector assumes a greater leadership role in addressing social inequalities. This requires equipping health and care workers to better understand how the social determinants of health impact patients and communities. Education of the health workforce is thus a key step to advancing action. Integration of the social determinants of health into education and training will prepare the workforce to adjust clinical practice, define appropriate public health programmes and leverage cross-sector policies and mechanisms. Because the conditions and circumstances in which people live are diverse and constantly changing, it follows that there is no single universal approach to addressing social determinants of health. However, there are common guiding and organizational principles that can be applied in health workforce education and training, in a consistent and reinforcing manner in all settings. This book aims to collate information produced by WHO on social determinants of health, to help the educators of health workers to integrate the social determinants of health into education and training.Nitish Kumar apologises as his comment raises furore
November 08, 2023 01:25 pm | Updated November 09, 2023 09:48 am IST - Patna/New Delhi COMMents SHARE READ LATER Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar speaks amid a protest by the Opposition MLAs over the remarks made by him on the importance of women’s education to control the population.
| Photo Credit: PTI A day after his “derogatory” comment in the State Assembly on the role of women’s education in population control, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday apologised both within and outside the House. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party in the State, however, demanded Mr. Kumar’s resignation while protesting inside the Assembly. After the National Commission for Women (NCW) took cognisance of Mr. Kumar’s controversial comment, a complaint was also filed against him in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district. “If my words have hurt anyone, I take them back. I apologise for whatever I said. I’m not only ashamed but condemn myself for making such comments,” said Mr. Kumar, amid the din created by Opposition BJP legislators inside the Assembly demanding his resignation over the “derogatory” comments. “My words were not intended to hurt anybody. I’ve always maintained that education is necessary for population control and I’ve always stood for women’s empowerment and their development,” he further clarified. On Tuesday, while participating in a debate on the caste survey report after it was tabled in the Assembly, Mr. Kumar had said, “The fertility rate in the State has come down from 4.3% to 2.9% due to the education of women. An educated woman is able to ensure that sex does not necessarily end in pregnancy, which helps keep the population in check.” Despite his apology on Wednesday, BJP MLAs continued their protest, trooping into the well of the House armed with placards demanding Mr. Kumar’s resignation, and calling his statement “vulgar”, “shameful”, and “sexist”. The Speaker of the House, Awadh Bihari Choudhary, had to adjourn the session twice on Wednesday. The BJP legislators continued to protest outside the Assembly as well. “He is not worthy of being a Chief Minister of the State now. We demand his immediate resignation over his vulgar and shameful comment inside the State Assembly on November 7. It seems he has lost his mental balance,” said the Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly and senior State BJP leader Vijay Kumar Sinha. “His deputy in the cabinet is talking about sex education. Both of them are not of worthy character,” he added. While defending Mr. Kumar’s comments, Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav had said, “One must not take it [Mr. Kumar’s statement] in the wrong sense. People are sometimes embarrassed to speak of it, but sex education is taught in schools. It is biology, and children study it.” While addressing a poll rally in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also took a dig at Mr. Kumar’s “indecent language”. “He has shamed all of us, the whole State feels embarrassed because of what he said on Tuesday inside the Assembly,” said BJP leader and party legislator Sanjiv Chaurasia. Some BJP leaders even alleged that Mr. Kumar’s “mind is infested with worms from B-grade Bollywood adult films”. Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan demanded that “President’s rule” be imposed in Bihar as “the entire State has been embarrassed by the statement of the Chief Minister”. Former Chief Minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Rabri Devi defended Mr. Kumar for his comments. “It may be a slip of tongue but Nitish Kumar ji has apologised for this,” Ms. Devi said. The NCW, however, strongly condemned Mr. Kumar’s remarks and asked the Speaker to take “strong action” against him. “Such derogatory and vulgar statements made by persons holding responsible positions shows extreme disrespect to women. Therefore, in view of the above, I urge for strong action against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his statement must be expunged from the records,” NCW chief Rekha Sharma wrote, in a letter to the Bihar Speaker. A lawyer, Anil Kumar Singh, also filed a complaint against Mr. Kumar in the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate in Muzaffarpur on Wednesday. A hearing in the matter will take place on November 25. Mr. Kumar has previously courted controversy with his comments on women. In November 2021, a woman BJP legislator Nikki Hembrom, from Banka district’s Katoria constituency (a seat reserved for Scheduled Tribes), had alleged that Mr. Kumar had used “foul” language against her at a National Democratic Alliance (NDA) legislators’ meeting which was called to mull the effective use of prohibition laws in the State. At the meeting, Mr. Kumar had allegedly told the woman BJP MLA, “You’re so good looking, but your thoughts are completely the opposite.” “Nitish Kumar’s objectionable comment left me shocked. Maybe he did not understand my concern but such words put a woman in the dock… His words were improper, they made me an object of fun and ridicule,” Ms. Hembrom had said at the time. The Janata Dal (United) was then a part of the NDA government along with the BJP; the relationship broke in August 2022, with Mr. Kumar snapping ties with the BJP to form a grand alliance government along with the RJD, the Congress, and other smaller parties.

Education Stakeholders from the Ministry of General Education and Instruction, Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare, Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Save the Children/US Board of Trustees visiting South Sudan, Children and Plan International ina group photo after the child-led session. The session under the theme, “My Voice My Right”, is dedicated to foster dialogue and hear children’s voices on educational needs and challenges in the country.  Save the Children facilitated children across the country to the face to face session with others who joined the session virtually from the states. According to the children, armed conflict, poverty, sexual exploitation, child marriage, negative cultural and traditional norms, physical harm, psychosocial distress, lack of enough scholastic materials and under motivation of teachers all hinder children’s education in South Sudan. “Here in Maban, girls are not sent to schools because of cultural norms, they say that girls cannot do what boys can do”, said  Imran*, 15, a student from Maban. More than 2.8 million children, or over 70 percent, are out of school in South Sudan, putting at risk their futures and the future of the country. Some of the out-of-school children are living in pastoral communities, moving with their cattle and are not able to attend regular classes. The largest group of out-of-school children in South Sudan are girls. The event organized by Save the Children on Thursday 9th November 2023 provides a platform for children to explore, comprehend and express themselves on aspects influencing educational performance. The discussion encourages children and young people to actively participate and have their voices shape decision making in this country. “Where there’s free learning, the quality of teachers also matters. Let’s take an example in lakes state, you can find a primary eight teacher [leaver] claiming to be a teachers whereby that person don’t have ethics and ethos for that profession.  The government should provide teachers training colleges in different states in both rural and urban areas for us to have quality teachers”, Juan*, 15,  a student from Juba and one of the child parliamentarians told stakeholders during the session. A high level delegates from the Ministry of General Education and Instruction, Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare, Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management, Save the Children US Board of Trustees visiting South Sudan and educational partners like Plan International attended the event. The Undersecretary of the Minister of General Education and Instruction, Hon. Kuyok Abol Kuyok, said; “It’s the right for everyone to go to school. The President of South Sudan has issued an order earlier this year for free basic education and it’s every child’s rights to go to school. The issues that you have raised are for us and we have to solve it. We need to get money to construct schools and to recruit trained teachers. Hon. Kuyok encourages the children to concentrate on your studies. Save the Children is piloting and coordinating  a child parliamentary initiative in five of the country's 10 states. The ultimate goal is to establish a national “Child Parliament” in the country in collaboration with other child-focused organizations and the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare. David Barth, Save the Children US Vice President for International Programs “We will go away from here speaking aggressively  about the importance of both access to education and improvement of quality education for all children with abilities and children with disability are all important.* we are honored by the intelligence of the children's parliament, we came for a purpose , to  learn and better understand your  vison for a country that will be yours*”, said David Barth, Save the Children US Vice President for International Programs Save the Children South Sudan education programme increases access to, and retention in safe, inclusive and quality basic education for all children in the country.Education Secretary Miguel Cardona delivers remarks to honor the Council of Chief State School Officers' 2020 and 2021 State and National Teachers of the Year at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 18, 2021. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Education Department will press forward with a "secret shopper" program to help ensure that companies properly service student loans as millions of borrowers begin repaying debt that had been put on hold during the pandemic. "As we're bringing folks back onto repayment, we need to make sure that the servicers are doing it well, and that they're responsive to the needs of the borrowers and when they're not, we're going to hold them accountable," Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told the Reuters NEXT conference. Under the so-called secret shopper program, Cardona said, the Education Department will send its employees to go through the loan process as if they are borrowers. The department said in a press release it will also listen in on some phone calls between borrowers and customer service representatives for loan servicers and score the performance of the servicers. "We're rolling out a roadmap that increases accountability, support and incentivizes those servicers that do exceptionally well or go above and beyond," Cardona said. Student loan payments were paused during the COVID-19 pandemic as shutdowns and other fallout from the spreading virus upended the U.S. economy but have since resumed. Last month, the Education Department said it withheld $7.2 million in payment to loan servicer MOHELA for failing to send billing statements on time to 2.5 million borrowers.

Students who want to pursue post graduate medical education next year will have to qualify the NEET-PG examination and not the new National Exit Test (NExT) that has been in the works, according to a tentative schedule released by the National Board of Examination on Thursday. NEET-PG 2024 will take place on March 3, the schedule said. This might come as a relief to many students who have been dreading the new format of the examination. NExT will be a common examination for completing MBBS, grant of medical licences and entering PG courses as a way to ensure uniform quality of medical education across the country with a focus on practical training. It will be conducted in two parts — the multiple choice part I will be conducted after MBBS course has been completed and the practical part II, after the students have completed their mandatory one-year internship. While NExT is mandated under the National Medical Commission Act, the government deferred it “till further directions” earlier this year. However, there were indications from the health minister and the union health ministry that the examination may likely happen in 2024. In fact, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences had also prepared to conduct a mock test to prepare students in the new format. Sources said the new format is likely to come into force only after the current general elections. “There was a need to defer the new examination. This is because there are several issues that remain like, who will conduct the examination, what kinds of questions will they ask, what happens if someone doesn’t pass the second test, what happens if a person does not get a seat of their choice with their marks and would people be allowed to re-appear in the test,” said Dr Rohan Krishnan, chairman, Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA). While the current format of examinations may continue, the NMC is looking at ways to streamline the counselling process and reduce seat vacancies. Over 1,400 post graduation medical seats remain vacant even after four rounds of PG counselling. The vacancy hasn’t gone down drastically even though the qualifying percentile has been reduced to zero for the current session. There were 4,614 vacant PG seats in 2019-20 after counselling was completed, 1,425 in 2020-21, and 3,744 in 2021-22.

volume 23, Article number: 852 (2023)
            Cite this article Metrics details Medical AI has transformed modern medicine and created a new environment for future doctors. However, medical education has failed to keep pace with these advances, and it is essential to provide systematic education on medical AI to current medical undergraduate and postgraduate students. To address this issue, our study utilized the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model to identify key factors that influence the acceptance and intention to use medical AI. We collected data from 1,243 undergraduate and postgraduate students from 13 universities and 33 hospitals, and 54.3% reported prior experience using medical AI. Our findings indicated that medical postgraduate students have a higher level of awareness in using medical AI than undergraduate students. The intention to use medical AI is positively associated with factors such as performance expectancy, habit, hedonic motivation, and trust. Therefore, future medical education should prioritize promoting students’ performance in training, and courses should be designed to be both easy to learn and engaging, ensuring that students are equipped with the necessary skills to succeed in their future medical careers. Peer Review reports In 1956, John McCarthy introduced the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) during the Dartmouth conference, marking the inception of this field [1]. Kaplan and Haenlein later defined AI as “the ability to process external data systematically and learn from it to achieve specific goals and tasks” [2]. The idea of using AI in medicine emerged in the early 1970s to enhance medical diagnosis and treatment. In recent years, there have been remarkable advancements in AI, leading to the development of medical AI systems capable of diagnosing diseases with expert-level accuracy [3]. This has brought about a revolution in medicine, improving healthcare services and promoting human health. The future of medical AI is expected to be even more promising, with potential applications including personalized treatment plans, drug development, and virtual healthcare assistants [4]. In China, some medical AIs have also been applied to daily clinic practice, such as in management of medical record and biobank information [5], disease screening [6,7,8] and diagnosing [9,10,11]. Despite increasing interest in this technology, medical education has not kept pace with the remarkable breakthroughs made in AI [12]. Although there have been calls to action, the adoption of AI training into medical education has been limited. As the adoption of AI continues to grow in healthcare, integration into medical education could offer substantial benefits for future practice, as medical education can reach the largest group of medical trainees early in their careers. Previous studies have shown that medical students are often not familiar with AI and may be worried about the potential for job loss [13,14,15]. However, they are generally enthusiastic about learning and using AI in their practice [16, 17]. Moreover, there is currently a lack of research exploring the significance of medical AI within the context of medical education in China. Therefore, understanding the attitudes of medical students toward medical AI is urgently needed to ensure the effective integration of this technology into medical education. However, there has been limited research on the acceptance and intention to use medical AI among medical undergraduate and postgraduate students. To address this gap, we select and implement a unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) model in this study. The UTAUT2 model is a commonly used theoretical framework for identifying potential factors that influence acceptance [18]. Its core principle is that the intention to use technology directly predicts actual usage [19]. While the UTAUT2 model is originally developed for the workplace context, it has also been successfully applied to other domains such as internet banking, digital education, and online gaming, as well as in the medical sector, such as for the adoption of electronic medical records [20,21,22,23], clinical decision support systems [24], and disease monitoring and management applications [25]. As the UTAUT2 model has demonstrated generalizability, the determinants of acceptance identified by the model may also serve as promising predictors for acceptance of medical AI. Given the significant and ongoing impact of medical AI on the practice of modern medicine, it is essential to integrate its use into medical education to enhance students’ performance in training and career development. This study investigated student perception of medical AI by UTAUT2 model, and made suggestion for future medical education and curriculum design. This study was a survey based on UTAUT2 model conducted in 13 universities and 33 hospitals. The survey comprised three sections. The first section informed all participants about the study’s purpose, their right to withdraw at any time, and that their data would be collected anonymously. The survey concluded when participants declined to participate. The second section collected demographic data, including participants’ school of medicine, age, sex, year of medical education, experience with AI, and self-evaluation of their experience of medical AI. The survey concluded when participants self-assessed themselves without experience of using AI or medical AI. The third section contained 38 5-point Likert questions focused on 10 factors: effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivations, price value, habit, facilitating condition, behavioral intention, technology fear, and technology trust. These questions were designed to assess medical students’ acceptance and intention to use medical AI. The survey was conducted online using Wen Juan Xing (www.wjx.cn) via WeChat and the web. The Likert scale used to quantify different dimensions or constructs ranged from 0 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The link of survey was sent by teachers to students during class. The Chinese medical students started to learn medicine upon entering university. Following a comprehensive 5-year medical education, these undergraduate students had the opportunity to advance their medical knowledge by gaining admission to a postgraduate school of medicine. This allows them to pursue further specialized medical education and training. Or they can take a 3-year training to become general practitioners. Based on the UTAUT2 model, we formulated 10 hypotheses to test key factors that exerted a significant influence on the acceptance and intention to use of medical AI among both medical undergraduate and postgraduate students. The hypotheses were listed below: Performance expectancy has a positive impact on behavioral intention towards the use of medical AI. Effort Expectancy has a positive impact on behavioral intention towards the use of medical AI. Social Influence has a positive impact on behavioral intention towards the use of medical AI. Hedonic Motivation have a positive impact on behavioral intention towards the use of medical AI. Price Value has a positive impact on behavioral intention towards the use of medical AI. Habit has a positive impact on behavioral intention towards the use of medical AI. Facilitating Conditions has a positive impact on the behavioral intention towards use of medical AI. Technology Fear has a negative impact on the behavioral intention towards use of medical AI. Trust has a positive impact on the behavioral intention towards use of medical AI. Behavioral intention has a positive effect on usage behavior in distance education systems. (1) Medical undergraduate students in their fourth and fifth years of study were included in this research. (Fourth-year undergraduate students were mandated to complete a year-long hospital internship). (2) All grade of medical postgraduate students were included. (3) No absent information in participants’ school of medicine, age, sex, year of medical education, experience with AI, and self-evaluation of their experience of medical AI. Partial least squares were used to analyze the path coefficients, which indicate the relationships between the dependent and independent variables. To measure the data’s internal reliability, Cronbach’s α was evaluated against the standard threshold of 0.7, the criterion for acceptable internal consistency of data. Convergent validity was calculated using average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability (CR). The discriminant validity of the measurement model was analyzed by using the restrictive method of the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) ratio to ensure that all values were below 0.9. The data analysis was conducted by using SmartPLS 4.0. The basic information of age, sex, year of medical education, experience with AI was analysis by chi-square test (SPSS 26.0). During a 2-week period, 1,243 undergraduate and postgraduate medical students from 13 universities and 33 hospitals completed the questionnaire. Of these, 41.5% (516) were male and 58.5% were female, 66.8% (830) were undergraduates and 33.2% (413) were postgraduates. The mean age was 24.9 ± 5.7 years old. Respondents were asked whether they were aware of using AI equipment or systems in their daily lives, and 199 respondents said they did not use AI equipment or software. Among the remaining 1,044 respondents, 369 had no experience of using medical AI. There was no significant difference between sex and self-evaluation of their experience of using AI and medical AI (χ2 = 0.02, p = 0.886). However, a significantly higher proportion of postgraduates (75.0%) reported had experience of using medical AI compared to undergraduates (59.5%, χ2 = 24.4, p < 0.001). Finally, a total of 675 respondents with experience of medical AI completed the survey. Figure 1 displayed the responses for each measurement scale. Table 1 showed the calculated values of Cronbach’s α, which ranged from 0.833 to 0.916, while CR varied in the range of 0.895–0.947 and AVE ranged from 0.623 to 0.856. To assess the discriminant validity of the measurement model, we used the restrictive method of the HTMT, which ensured that all values were below 0.9. (Table 2) The responses for each measurement scale The results of the hypothesis testing for the standardized path coefficients and path significance are presented in Table 3; Fig. 2, which showed that performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, habit, and trust had a positive influence on the intention to use medical AI. Path ecoefficiency analysis. ***, P < 0.001 This study aims to investigate the factors influencing the acceptance of medical artificial intelligence (AI) among undergraduate and postgraduate medical students, using the UTAUT2 framework. The study identifies performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, habit, and trust as the primary drivers that impact the acceptance and utilization of medical AI. Performance expectancy refers to individual’s belief that utilizing a specific system would be more beneficial to him/her and would improve the performance of the task. Our results were consistent with previous research, particularly in the context of e-learning environments. For instance, Oye et al. found that the performance expectancy of medical educators positively impacted their acceptance and use of information technologies in the workplace [26]. Hedonic motivation refers to the user’s pleasure derived from utilizing a system. The confirmation of hedonic motivation in this study strongly indicates its positive influence on behavioral intention. These findings align with the results reported by Tarhini, et al. and Moorthy, et al. [27, 28]. Habit refers to the automatic or habitual behavior individuals develop in their use of technology. The significance of habit as a predictor of behavioral intention has been highlighted in previous research as well [29, 30]. Venkatesh et al. demonstrated that the routine use of a technology had a notable impact on its adoption [18]. Trust represents another crucial factor driving the acceptance and intention to use medical AI. Previous studies have consistently shown significant direct relationships between trust and behavioral intention, trust and attitude, and trust and usage intention. Cabrera-Sánchez et al. were pioneers in introducing trust into the UTAUT2 model, and their research demonstrated the significant role of trust in shaping consumer behavioral intent to use AI applications [19]. Our findings revealed that only 675 (54.3%) participants self-reported familiarity with medical AI, indicating that nearly half of the medical students were not acquainted with this field. Furthermore, a limited number of medical schools in China had incorporated medical AI into their curriculum for students. In addition, we found performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, habit, and trust were key factors that affected the use of medical AI. Given these outcomes, we propose the following recommendations for the future medical AI education:: Enhance Awareness: Given the considerable proportion of students unfamiliar with medical AI, efforts should be directed towards heightening awareness through educational activities. Curriculum Enrichment: Collaborative efforts between academia and industry should be pursued to integrate medical AI topics into the curriculum, ensuring students are well-versed in this evolving field. Addressing Student Needs: Focus on training that addresses students’ performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, habit formation, and trust, as these emerged as crucial factors influencing medical AI adoption. (1) For performance expectancy, future medical AI education should prioritize teaching students how to leverage its use to improve their training outcomes and future careers. (2) For habit and hedonic motivation, teacher should deliver enjoyable and entertaining experience when utilizing medical AI. (3) For trust, it is important for teachers to instruct students on how to assess the reliability and credibility of medical AI systems. Enhancing Performance: medical AI should emphasize assisting students in gathering critical medical information, streamlining tasks with speed and precision, and enhancing overall performance. User Friendly and Engaging: Considering the importance of hedonic motivation and habit, students anticipate an enjoyable and entertaining experience when utilizing medical AI. Interactions involving issuing commands, asking questions, and receiving prompt replies or necessary information contribute to a sense of hedonic pleasure, enhancing the engagement and appeal of the technology. Establishing Trust: Trust plays a crucial role in the acceptance and utilization of medical AI among medical students. Medical AI systems that offer the latest disease guidelines or cutting-edge medical knowledge are likely to be well-received by students. Despite its contributions, our study has several limitations that should be considered. Firstly, the online survey method and voluntary participation may have introduced a bias by only attracting students interested in the subject matter. Secondly, while our data was collected from 33 hospitals and 11 universities in seven provinces of China, caution should be exercised when generalizing the results to the entire country. Thirdly, even though AI has been applied in clinical medicine for some time, medical undergraduates and postgraduates in China have not yet received systematic education on medical AI. Consequently, the perspectives conveyed by the participants are inevitably shaped by their interactions with the specific medical AI tools they engage with in their routine practices. This variation in exposure has inherently led to a spectrum of attitudes towards different medical AI applications. Future studies could further investigate the intricate relationship between a specific and universally embraced medical AI education approach and its potential to enhance students’ academic performance. With the increasing prevalence of AI technologies in the field of medicine, it is evident that future medical undergraduate and postgraduate students will operate within a different professional landscape. However, despite this paradigm shift, students currently lack structured and standardized education on medical AI, which can leave them feeling uninformed and unprepared. This study has identified key factors that influence the acceptance and utilization of medical AI among students, emphasizing the imperative for future education that focuses on promoting performance in training and career through AI adoption, as well as the ability to discern the reliability and credibility of AI systems. It is crucial to design medical AI courses that are both user-friendly and engaging, ensuring that students acquire the essential skills to thrive in their forthcoming medical careers.

Published: Nov 09, 2023 Highly visible intersection at the foot of the Bay Bridge has been revamped into a vibrant public space Clean California has to date cleared 2 million cubic yards of litter from roadsides and employed 8,700 people SAN FRANCISCO — Governor Gavin Newsom joined state and local leaders today to unveil a state-of-the-art tree nursery and education center at a previously vacant, blighted lot near a highly visible intersection in San Francisco. This is one of 3,275 Clean California sites cleaned statewide under the Governor’s $1.2 billion, multiyear effort led by Caltrans to remove trash, create thousands of jobs and engage communities to revitalize public spaces. The $3.5 million revitalization project highlighted today was designed in partnership with Caltrans, the San Francisco Department of Public Works and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Governor Newsom announced a major milestone for Clean California: since its launch in July 2021, Caltrans has cleared more than 2 million cubic yards of litter from California roadways – enough litter to span the length of the Golden Gate Bridge 670 times – and the program has employed 8,700 people. “Back when I was Mayor of San Francisco, this particular state-owned site was always a source of frustration – we could never seem to keep it clean and we couldn’t get the state to engage. That’s why we made it a priority for Clean California – and why I’m especially excited for today’s milestone. This once blighted area that serves as a vital gateway to San Francisco has been transformed into a landscape that all San Franciscans and Californians can be proud of.” Governor Gavin Newsom Located at the intersection of Interstate 80 and 5th Street in San Francisco, this active tree nursery will offer visitors unique opportunities to learn about the benefits of trees for people and the environment, including the chance to engage with arborists. “The opening of our first City-run street tree nursery is important for so many reasons,” said San Francisco Mayor London N. Breed. “First, we’re nurturing home-grown trees instead of outsourcing them from so many miles away. This means we’re emitting less carbon in the process and stepping closer towards our climate goals. Second, we’re making sure we can better prioritize new trees in neighborhoods that have historically been left out from these investments so that all San Franciscans can have access to cleaner air, more green spaces, and a healthier environment. I’m grateful to Governor Newsom for committing funding to this project last year, and all of our State partners at Caltrans, CalFire, and the California Natural Resources Agency for making today a reality.” Last week, Caltrans unveiled another Clean California project in San Francisco, along 4th Street between Yerba Buena Gardens and the Moscone Transit Center. And last month, Governor Newsom announced the latest round of Clean California grants to cities, local governments and transit agencies throughout the state, which included $3.3 million to clean transit stations and bus stops throughout San Francisco.  Before and after photos overlooking a key gateway to and from San Francisco at the base of the Bay Bridge that has been transformed under Clean California into a tree nursery and educational center.

Governor Newsom at Fifth Street Tree Nursery project ribbon-cutting Clean California has helped individuals overcome barriers to employment, including 357 people who had been experiencing homelessness, and has drawn more than 10,000 volunteers to events ranging from community cleanups to large debris collections for appliances, tires and mattresses. As this effort moves forward, Caltrans and local communities will continue to raise awareness of the negative impact litter has on natural resources, waterways, public safety and public health to help drive a cultural shift of shared responsibility for clean and vibrant public spaces. Caltrans is also developing a program in which communities throughout the state can earn a special Clean California Community designation by meeting criteria centered around preventing and cleaning up litter, promoting recycling and greening or beautifying neighborhoods.

So has Nick Gibb, a staunch proponent of such approaches, won the education war? Schools Week investigates… “Academisation and free schools work,” wrote Mark Lehain last month, the former special adviser who soon after returned to the fold with the education secretary. “More rigorous curriculums and exams work. Explicit approaches to behaviour and teaching work.” The comment echoed many from proponents of traditional approaches after the publication of last year’s progress 8 league tables, where some of the highest-flyers were schools with strong traditionalist values. Schools Week has established that at least 10 of the top 20 schools are “traditional”, although it could be higher as it is essentially a subjective judgment. But some of the best-performing schools are clearly in this category. Michaela Community School in west London topped the progress 8 tables with a score of 2.37 (which means pupils achieve more than two grades better per subject than pupils with similar prior attainment at the end of primary school). Led by Katharine Birbalsingh, often labelled “Britain’s strictest headteacher”, the school is renowned for its silent corridors, no SEND labels and detentions for failing to have a pen. Mercia School in Sheffield – dubbed by some as the “Michaela of the north” – came third with a progress score of 2.22. The school day runs until 5pm every day except Friday, when pupils finish at 3.45pm. Dean Webster, its head, describes its approach as “warm-strict”, but added there was often a “stigma” around traditional schools. “Ultimately all we are ever doing is doing the best by children and we are achieving that. It changes lives and the grades that they get is the passport for the next phase of their life.” Lehain, in a blog last month for the online newspaper CapX, said the results were “yet more vindication” of the Conservative’s education reforms. He also said “many of the schools who have explicitly and publicly rejected these traditional approaches in favour of progressive ones are doing far worse than average”. Again, identifying a list is difficult. But one of the flagship progressive schools is School 21, a free school in east London co-founded by Peter Hyman, Keir Starmer’s current senior adviser. School 21, downgraded from ‘outstanding’ to ‘requires improvement’ earlier this year, had a progress score of -0.32, which is classed as “average”. The school did not comment. But its website states it “operates with the conviction that schools need to ensure a focus on head (academic success), heart (character and well-being) and hand (generating ideas, problem-solving, making a difference)”. Two Doncaster secondary schools at XP School Trust, also well-known for its progressive approach, had “well below average” scores of -0.64 at XP East and -0.58 at XP School. Its website states the trust “believes that our children deserve a three-dimensional education focused on academic performance, character growth and beautiful work”. The trust declined to comment. But there is a big caveat: schools with certain pupil cohorts tend to do better in progress. Jo Hutchinson, the director for SEND at the Education Policy Institute (EPI), said these “limitations” meant results varied “considerably by a range of factors that are outside the school’s control”. For instance, the average score for pupils with English as an additional language was 0.51, compared with -0.12 for non-EAL. Out of the top 50 progress 8 schools, 36 had above-average levels of EAL pupils. Michaela and Tauheedul Islam Girls’ High School in Blackburn, the two highest-performing progress schools in the country, had just shy of 70 per cent of EAL youngsters. The national average is 18.1 per cent. FFT Datalab said some pupils would have recently arrived in the country when they took their SATs in year 6, so their results “may not have been a fair reflection of their attainment” at the time. If you exclude these pupils, the differences are actually down to ethnicity. For instance, there is a wide progress gap between black Caribbean EAL and non-EAL pupils, while there is to no gap for Chinese students in both groups. Faith schools were also a factor, Hutchinson said. The EPI researchers found in 2016 that faith schools had more pupils achieving five A*s to C than non-faith schools. The same applies to progress 8. Results seem to back this up. Faith schools make up 34 of the top 50 progress 8 schools, despite accounting for just one in five secondary schools nationally. In fact, just three of the top 10 schools are non-faith based. That includes Mercia. “You could argue … that if you are a family that has faith then the values of schools like ours, that are traditional, fit with those family values and the offer is attractive,” said Webster. EPI researchers put the difference down to faith schools tending to have fewer disadvantaged children and pupils with SEND. Traditional schools also face this criticism. Their strict approaches to behaviour are sometimes not inclusive for children with additional needs and can result in them moving to other schools, critics say. Eleven of the top 50 progress schools are grammars, which have far fewer disadvantaged pupils than average. But even excluding these, 24 of the remaining 39 schools have below average numbers of poorer children. Michaela is one of the few that has more (31.1 per cent across the school compared to a 27.1 per cent England average). But Dave Thomson, chief statistician at FFT Datalab, said progress 8 scores in some schools were “so high that even if you take into account that they are girls’ schools or that some groups of pupils, such as EAL pupils, perform slightly better, the differences are so great it’s not just down to that. “It could be down to teaching and learning. But it could also be down to other external factors such as parental support and tutoring.” In 2019, researchers at the University of Bristol created an “adjusted” progress 8 to re-weight a pupil’s score according to factors such as their ethnicity, free school eligibility and gender. In their alternate performance tables, 41 per cent of schools deemed to be underperforming or “well below average” moved out of that category. Researcher professor George Leckie said they would re-run the measure next year. He expected a “greater reordering of schools now than pre-pandemic, because schools in harsher circumstances have fallen further behind. “It’s not that the quality of teaching has worsened, it’s the multiple challenges and struggles of the student body. There’s a greater need.” Becks Boomer-Clark, the chief executive of the Academies Enterprise Trust, asked “how to overlay” factors such as SEND, disadvantage and location on top of progress 8 to get a “more nuanced and accurate understanding of the added value that a school is providing”. Jonny Uttley, the chief executive officer at The Education Alliance, said a single measure allows people to “obsess about it” and “try and score political points”. He said a “balanced scorecard”, which included contextual data alongside progress 8, would be more suitable. Rob Tarn, the chief executive at the Northern Education Trust, cautioned contextualising could lead to “lower expectations in more vulnerable schools”. But he supported the idea of a dashboard of various measures. “What we need is a more grown-up, broader view of school performance.” Labour did not respond to comment on whether it would add more context into progress 8. But the party has announced plans to hold schools to account for performance in at least one creative or vocational subject. The DfE said there were “no current plans” to include a new contextual value-added measure. progress 8 was designed to “encourage schools to offer a broad and balanced curriculum, with a strong focus on an academic core”.
